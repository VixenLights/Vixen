====================================================================================================
Changes in 2.0.0 (Beta):
====================================================================================================

New / Changed / Extended Interfaces:
	public interface ISecurityManager
	public interface ISecurityDomainObject
	public interface IModelObject : ISecurityDomainObject
	public interface ILayerCollection : ICollection<Layer> 
	public interface IRepository
	public interface ICommand
	public interface IModelMapping
  See documentation of these interfaces for details.

Changes in base classes:
- Removed class "DefaultSecurity"
- New method in class Shape: HasStyle(IStye style) - return true if the given Style is used by the 
  shape.
- Shape.NotifyStyleChanged now uses HasStyle which has to be implemented. Therefore, NotifyStyleChanged 
  was made protected internal.
- New Method: Project.RemoveLibrary
- New Property: Project.AutoLoadLibraries (see "Behavior Changes")
- New Parameter for methods Project.AddLibrary, Project.AddLibraryByName and Project.AddLibraryByFilePath
  (see "Behavior Changes")
- Removed History.CommandExecuted event because it was obsolete. Use CommandsExecuted event instead.
- Several Methods of various classes were renamed. The old versions are marked as obsolete.
- PointerTool was renamed to SelectionTool. PointerTool is now marked as obsolete.
- New method in LinearShapeBase for calculating the bounding rectangle of the line (without line caps): 
  protected abstract Rectangle CalcBoundingRectangleCore(bool tight)
- Design class now has a Title property.

Namespace Changes:
- All collection classes are now in Dataweb.NShape.Collections
- All command classes are now in Dataweb.NShape.Commands
- Shape class, Template class and Tool classes are now in Dataweb.NShape
- Moved several classes from Dataweb.NShape.Advanced to Dataweb.NShape (or vice versa)

Behavior Changes:
- Project will no longer unload all libraries when opening a project. Libraries added by the application
  without the "unloadOnClose" option will not be unloaded. See Documentation for details.
- Project will no longer load needed libraries automatically (potential security issue). 
  In order to restore this behavior, set the project's AutoLoadLibrary property to true. See Documentation 
  for details.
- IRepository.GetDiagram and IRepository.GetDiagrams no longer load the diagram with all shapes but 
  the diagram object only (SQL Repository only).
- Therefore you have to call IRepository.GetDiagramShapes(Diagram diagram) when fetching the diagram 
  from Respository and not displaying it with the WinformsUI.Display component.
  Note that DiagramSetController.OpenDiagram and Display.OpenDiagram/LoadDiagram load the diagram 
  including all of its shapes.
- IRepository: Insert/Update/Delete/Undelete methods will only insert/update/delete/undelete the 
  given object(s) but no child- and contained objects.
- IRepository: InsertAll/DeleteAll/UndeleteAll will insert/delete/undelete the given objects(s) 
  and all their child- and contained objects.
- Template.GetTerminalName(TerminalId.Generic) no longer throws an ArgumentOutOfRangeException
- IsAllowed of an empty collection of shapes (where no domain name is obtainable) now checks if the 
  required permission is granted for at least one domain and returns this result.
- Shape.CalculateBoundingRectangle returns Geometry.InvalidRectangle if calculation of a bounding 
  rectangle is not possible. Check with the Geometry.IsValid method.
- Permissions are now split into Domain Permissions and General permissions. See documentation and for 
  details.

New Features:
- New CapStyle shapes available, all non-sizable (simple line-endings)
- Display.CopyImageToClipboard() copies the selected shapes (or the diagram if no shapes are selected) 
  as image to the clipboard.
- Shape libraries can be removed now
- NShape designer: Ctrl+A shortcut for "Select all shapes"
- New Shape: Regular Polygone (3 to Int32.MaxValue control points)
- New Shape: Free Triangle
- New Shape: Rectangular line
- Insertable/Deletable connection points (not vertices) for line shapes
- The AdoNet Store now supports partial loading (see behavior change of Repository.GetDiagram)
- Libraries can now be unloaded from the project (if not used any longer).
- Renamed line cap style "Arrow" to "ClosedArrow"
- New line cap styles: OpenArrow, Round (Default style), Flat and Peak. Round, Flat and Peak have
  no size.
- Dragging resize points with pressed Shift key will resize the shape with constant aspect ratio
  if shape supports MoveControlPoint with ResizeModifier.MaintainAspect flag set.
- Dragging resize points with pressed Ctrl key will resize the shape to both directions if shape 
  supports MoveControlPoint with ResizeModifier.MirroredResize flag set.

Improvements:
- Improved Diagram Export Dialog: 
  * A file extension will be added when not specifying one
  * If the file name's extension will adjust when switching to another image format (except when the 
    file has a non-standard extension)
  * Calling the export dialog with an empty diagram no longer produces an error message
- Improved copying the size of a shape when calling Shape.CopyFrom() other shape type
- Improved Shape.Fit() when the shape has children that exceed the parent's bounds
- Improved hit testing of GeneralShapes.ThickArrow specific implementation of ContainsPointCore())
- SoftwareArchitectureShapes.EntitySymbol: When editing a caption, all other captions will 
  not be rendered transparent any longer
- SoftwareArchitectureShapes.EntitySymbol: Fixed bug in hit test of the last caption
- Delete Template will 
- Re-activated ResizeModifiers for resizing shapes
- MoveControlPointTo/MoveControlPointBy did not always return false if the point could not be moved 
  to the specified position
- Before a style or a template can be deleted, the repository is checked if it is still used by any 
  object (objects that are currently not loaded will be checked too)
- AdoNetStore: Connection to the database will not be opened/closed for every nested/recursive call
- Improved copy/paste shapes: Pasted shapes will be placed more accurate at the position where they
  are expected
- Improved error message when trying to load a repository with a version that is not supported.
- LibraryManagementDialog implements removing libraries now. Changes are now performed when closing 
  the dialog with OK
- NShape Designer: New menu item "Tools" / "Test Data Generator" for creating diagrams
- Saving a "PictureShape" displaying an emf image will now release the file lock of saved EMF file.
- NShape Designer will no longer load all diagrams with all shapes when opening a project. 
  Instead, it will create a tab for each diagram in the project. The diagrams will be loaded when 
  switching to the appropriate tab.
- NShape Designer does not load the diagram shapes when opening the project (if the Store supports 
  partial loading, e.g. the SQLStore). The shapes will be loaded when clicking the diagram's tab. 
- Closing many "NShape Designer" instances at once will no longer produce an error message.
- Demo Program „Shuffle Game“ now works with Display.ShapeClick event instead of Display.MouseClick 
  event and uses more NShape specific methods for finding and moving shapes.
- LayerController now uses the new LayerEditCommand instead of the PropertySetCommand<Layer>, thus
  avoiding the usage of reflection
- Layouter Dialog deactivates its Undo/Redo buttons if there is nothing left to undo/redo
- XmlStore.DirectoryName now ofers designer support in VisualStudio's WinForms Designer (offers a 
  [...] button that opens a "Select Directory" dialog)
- NShape Designer: Zoom setting is now "per diagram".
- Demo project "Flow Chart" now uses sticked labels instead of loose text shapes
- Display now suports the following shortcut commands: Shift+Del (Cut), Shift+Ins (Copy) and 
  Ctrl+Ins (Paste)
- Exceptions thrown in Form_Load event handler will be catched by the base class, so we added 
  try/catch handlers in all Tutorial projects.
- New property PropertyController.PropertyDisplayMode: Properties can now be completly hidden or 
  displayed as read only if their RequiredPermission is not granted.
- Readonly Permissions can be granted via the SecurityAccess enum and the appropriate overloads of
  SetPermission(). Granting a Permission with SecurityAccess.View means that the property is displayed 
  as readonly. See documentation for details.

BugFixes:
- Display no longer throws an exception when beeing placed on a control with transparent background 
  color, as it was the case with TabControl pages.
- When using more than one design, the design editor did not display the correct styles in 
  the property editor
- A call to Repository.Update() was missing in Tutorial "Templates"
- TerminalMapping on ReferencePoint were not stored in Repository
- TerminalMappings were not restored when loading from an SQL Repository
- Diagram.CreateImage(): Image background color was not working for „Classic EMF“ format

  correctly refreshes the layouted shapes.
- Setting a ContextMenuStrip for the ToolBoxListView component now works as expected and no longer
  resets the property to null.
- Pressing „Del“ key when no shapes are selected no longer results in an exception.
- CircularArc consisting of 2 points now inserts itself correctly into the spatial index of the 
  diagram and therefore is now clickable as expected.

- RTU shape in SoftwareArchitectoreShapes: Changing the backgrond color now works as expected.
- Saving SQLRepositories containing SoftwareArchitectureShapes no longer produces an exception
- Assigning a new style to a template loaded from an SQLStore no longer results in an exception
- PictureShape with an empty picture (height or width 0) no longer produces an exception
- Scrolling with mouse wheel and scrolling with universal scroll (middle mouse button) now raises
  Scroll events as expected
- Deleted entities are no longer returned when by the Repository’s GetXXXs() methods.
- If trying to fetch a deleted object with the Repositoriy’s GetXXX(object id) method, an NShapeException 
  is now thrown.
- UniteRectangles(RectangleF a, RectangleF b) now behaves like UniteRectangles(Rectangle a, Rectangle b).
- When adding Vertices and deleting them in the same order they were created, undoing/redoing this changes
  no longer cause a wrong ControlPointId assignment for the added vertices.
- When editing a caption of an EntitySymbol shape (SoftwareArchitectureShapes library), clicking an
  other caption no longer renders the captions transparent
- Last caption of EntitySymbol shapes can now be removed as expected by context menu.
- Height of EntitySymbol's header text is now calculated correctly when containing a line break
- Styles can no longer be deleted if they are used in other styles or shapes (even if the shapes are not

- Splitted source code file "LinearShape.cs" into "LinearShape.cs", "PolyLineBase.cs" and "CircularArcBase.cs"
- New Behavior: Shapes with editable captions show a "edit text area" hint.
  This is because the methods CaptionedShapeBase.GetCaptionBounds and CaptionedShapeBase.GetCaptionTextBounds 
  always return placeholder bounds in case there is no text in the caption
- Bugfix: When dragging a connection point to the center point of a shape, the connection points were not 
  highlighted correctly.
- Bugfix: Shapes derived from "TextBase" now return false when moving a control point with AutoSize 
  enabled.
- EntityPropertyDefinitions are sorted by type (EntityFieldDefinitions first InnerObjectDefinitions last)
  in the constructor of the ShapeType. When adding new properties to the persistance interface,
  you do not have to sort the propertyDefinitions manually any longer

- Aggregated shapes keep their original ZOrder when aggregating. 
- When creating an aggregated shape with the display's context menu, the aggregation's base shape is 
  no longer the clicked shape but the bottommost shape.
- New demo program: The WPF Demo demonstrates how to integrate NShape in WPF applications with the 
  WindowsFormsHost component. 
- Replaced several string comparisons using the == operator by a string.Compare() using the comparison 
  parameter "InvariantCultureIgnoreCase"
- Marked "CalculateConnectionFoot(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)" as [Obsolete] because in the next 
  version it will be replaced
- Bugfix: Diagram's spatial index did store a cell for a shape if a cell with the same cell key already 
  existed
- NShapeExceptions are serializable now
- If the permission for executing a command is not granted, a NShapeSecurityException is thrown instead 
  of an InvalidOperationException.
- The ImageEditor dialog (that appears then selecting an Image for a diagram, shape or style) now sets
  the name of the image file.
- New Behavior of Display: If a shape is moded outside the diagram bounds, the display it will not 
  scroll it into view.
- Bugfix: Solved several issues concerning scrolling and scroll bars of the display component.
- Interface IDisplayPresenter: New Method Update() forces the display to update immediately. 
  This results in a subjectivly faster preview when dragging many shapes, comlpex shapes or picture 
  shapes with large pictures.
- NShape Designer: New projects or projects saved unter a different file name now appear in the 
  "Recent Projects" list right after saving.
- When cancelling or closing the file save dialog while saving, the whole save operation is cancelled 
  and the project will not be closed.
- Bugfix: Padding of TextShape's Paragraph style was calculated twice. Therefore the spacing between 
  shape's outline and text was too large.
- Changed behavior of RepulsionLayouter: The user/the application HAS to select the shapes to be 
  layouted. Labels (which change their relative position to the connected partner shape when moved) 
  are no longer automatically excluded from the layout process. Labels connected to lines via 
  PointToShape connection no longer cause a crash.
- Changes in Tutorial:
  * Shapes are now created in the middle of the diagram as they are not visible without scrolling 
    otherwise
  * Added necessary call to Layouter.Prepare() before executing the layouter
  * Changed references to NShape assemblies to "Version Specific" = False
- Demo program "Shuffle Demo" renamed to "VB Demo"
- Bugfix: SQLStore now stores inner objects "ColumnNames" of SoftwareArchitectureShapes.Entity shapes.

- Bugfix: AggregatedShape threw Exception when setting Width or Height to 0
- Bugfix: FlowLayouter no longer crashes when layouting in "Bottom Up" mode.
- Bugfix: NShape Designer calls SaveAs when trying to save a new project but database repositories do 
  not support "SaveAs".
- Changed behavior: When creating a new template from a shape (via context menu), the shape of the new 
  template is not dependent from any other template.
- When saving a project, ...
  * ... the project is saved in a temporary file ("~ProjectName.xml") that is renamed after saving 
    completed successfully
  * ... when overwriting or saving an existing project, a backup file is created ("ProjectName.bak")
- Bugfix: Changing a template's shape only worked once.
- Workaround: On 64 bit OSes, Metafile.PlayRecord() does not play certain records. Unfortunately, one 
  of the affected records is "CreateBrushIndirect which is used for replacing colors in the 
  CustomizableMetafile class. As Microsoft has not corrected the bug yet (nor shown a satisfying 
  workaround for it), we've changed the CustomizableMetafile.
