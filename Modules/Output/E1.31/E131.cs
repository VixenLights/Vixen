// E131.cs - common E1.31 classes
// written from the ground up based on the protocol specifications
// from E1.31 published documentation available. in no way is
// this claimed to be an official implementation endorsed or
// certified in any way.
// mainly a collection of classes used to build, send, receive,
// and manipulate the E1.31 protocol in a logical vs. physical
// format. the three layers are represented as C# classes without
// concerns of actual transport formatting. the PhyBuffer member
// converts the values to/from a byte array for transport in
// network normal byte ordering and packing.
// this is not the most efficient way. it tries to be object
// oriented instead of efficient to cleanly implement the
// protocol.
// there are other ways through interop marshalling that may
// be more efficient for the 'conversion' between logical vs.
// physical but they may then be less efficient for manipulation
// of the resultant data within C# with its System.Object based
// reference variable etc. and there is always the big-endian
// vs. little-endian conversions to take into account.
// however once built, if a copy of the phybuffer is preserved,
// it only needs to be 'patched' in two places (sequence # and slots)
// and reused to send another packet of the same format.
// version 1.0.0.0 - 1 june 2010
